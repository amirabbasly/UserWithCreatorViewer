# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
=======
# UserWithCreatorViewer
This React component connects to the Django backend API (getUserWithCreator) to fetch and display a user’s information along with their creator’s profile. It's optimized for readability, scalability, and clean integration with any admin panel, dashboard, or user management system.
